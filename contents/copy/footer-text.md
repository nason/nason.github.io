Thank you for visiting my site. I hope you enjoyed your stay. This static site is built using open-source tools, and I have published its source publicly on [GitHub][1].

I build software with Node.js, JavaScript, Backbone, HTML5, CSS3, Ruby on Rails and many others. Previously, I founded Zip Eyewear. [More about meâ†’][2]
