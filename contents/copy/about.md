## Code

I have been programming for as long as I can remember. My first experience with code involved a 5.25" floppy disk (the actual, floppy kind) on a Tandy PC.

I love connecting the dots between different aspects of development. I find that Web development hits a sweet spot for me, and requires me to constantly learn and improve. 

## Previously

The focus of my higher education was the influence of technology on human evolution in terms of biology (specifically neurobiology) and society over the last ~150,000 years.

My coursework was primarily in Computer Science, Biology and Anthropology.

After school I founded a company, [Zip Eyewear](http://www.zipeyewear.com), to bring new technology to a market that desperately needed change.


## Particles & Waves

One of the most fascinating things I've ever learned is that light exhibits properties of both particles and waves. I know, I know, we all learned and glossed over that tidbit in high school science..

But this paradox goes beyond light. All of this gets super interesting at the quantum scale, where every particle also has wave-like properties.

Wave-particle duality means that I am both particles & waves, you are both particles & waves, everything you see, hear, feel or think is both particles & waves. I think this is a pretty fascinating perspective.

### More Info

I suppose even my code is both particles & waves. You can find more info about/from me [right here on my blog](/blog/), on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/nason), or on [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelnason).
