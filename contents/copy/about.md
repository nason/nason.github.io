## Code

I love connecting the dots between different aspects of computing and software development. I find that web development hits a sweet spot for me in the way it challenges me to constantly learn and improve.

## Previously

My first experience with code was nearly 20 years ago -- I had my first paid programming gig at the age of 15.

In college, I focused on the influence of technology on human evolution in terms of biology (mainly neurobiology and genetics) and society over the last ~150,000 years.

After school I founded [Zip Eyewear](http://www.zipeyewear.com) to deliver progressive technology to a niche market. My company was ultimately out-competed, but these years were full of incredible experiences.

I think this is a pretty fascinating perspective.
