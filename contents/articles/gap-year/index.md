Well, I spent all this effort making a fancy site, but then failed to write content for it. It's been nearly a year since I re-launched my site and wrote my last post.

----------------------
I've had plenty of thoughts and things to say in that time, but I guess I've been too busy to sit down and write. Some points of interest:

### 1. A new job
Since I last wrote, I started a new (and awesome!) job as a software engineer at Bazaarvoice.

We build an insanely cool platform around user generated review content for brands and retailers. You've probably used our software while shopping online.

I'm very grateful for my team(s) and all the things I get to learn each day.

### 2. A new app
I've been made responsible for re-writing a server-rendered dashboard as a single-page, client-rendered application.

Its in production now with a core set of functionality. We're transitioning the rest of the old pages as needed, and adding new features only to the new app.

This has been a fantastic experience (though, terrifying sometimes) in application architecture, design, handling a legacy codebase, and most of all, teaching.

Most of my teammates haven't had much experience with SPAs, so its been up to me to design the application to be easy to learn, and to help my teammates ramp up and contribute to the project. In the process, we've also had some interns rotate through our team and get in on the action.

Everyone has definitely sharpened up on JavaScript and our team is able to deliver new features quickly that would have otherwise been very difficult. This has been a privelidge.

### 3. Many new experiences
Life has been good. I moved back to Austin for 3 months while ramping up at Bazaarvoice with the incredible team there.

Then I moved back to SF.

Then I moved to Berkeley.

All through that it's been non-stop &mdash; friends, family, fun &mdash; I'm loving it.

### 4. Another new site
I was staying with my brother in Austin and built him a website: [nasonmd.com](http://nasonmd.com)

Nothing super complex there but another performant, easily maintainable and deployable static site. I'm considering open-sourcing that one as well. Leave me a note if that would help you.

### 5. A new commitment
I'm going to push myself here, publicly, and commit to writing at least one new post every month.

More is better, but I've never been very good at blogging consistently.

Expect technical and non-technical posts somewhat regularly.

----------------------


So that's that. Pretty much one more lap around the sun.

Time to get back on this horse.
