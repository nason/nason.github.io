They encountered a bit of a roadblock distributing their content at companies they work with: HR departments often don’t have accurate or up-to-date employee email addresses or mobile phone numbers.

I teamed up with ForUs to develop an open-source tool, Bridgely, that helps bridge this gap and enables companies to deliver content to employees via text messaging.

They are an awesome company that makes interactive <span class=amp>&amp;</span> intelligent guides about retirement benefits. Honestly, what do you know about your 401(k)? They help make this stuff simple and actionable. I think its&nbsp;great.</p><p>They encountered a bit of a roadblock distributing their content at companies they work with: <span class=caps>HR</span> departments often don’t have accurate or up-to-date employee email addresses or mobile phone&nbsp;numbers.</p><p><img src=/articles/bridgely-text-messaging-for-corporations/bridgely_logo.4c39cadf.png alt=bridgely_logo></p><p>I teamed up with ForUs to develop an open-source tool, <a href=https://github.com/nason/bridgely>Bridgely</a>, that helps bridge this gap and enables companies to deliver content to employees via text messaging. <span class="more"></p><h2 id=bridgely>Bridgely</h2><p>At a high level, Bridgely is a mobile communications platform that makes corporate communications via <span class=caps>SMS</span> a snap. It is opt-in only, meaning employees have to send a text message to the company to register for these&nbsp;communications.</p><p><img src=https://raw.github.com/nason/bridgely/master/screenshots/welcome.png alt="Bridgely is a mobile communications platform that gives companies the ability to send text messages to employees"></p><p>Not only can Bridgely broadcast messages to any number of employees, two-way communication is also possible. Questions can be asked via <span class=caps>SMS</span>, and <span class=caps>SMS</span> responses can be stored as tags on each employee. This feature allows a company to ask questions&nbsp;like:</p><blockquote><p>What department do you work&nbsp;in?</p></blockquote><p>or</p><blockquote><p>We’re planning a company dinner. Would you prefer a chicken, steak, or vegetarian&nbsp;option?</p></blockquote><p><img src=https://raw.github.com/nason/bridgely/master/screenshots/send_question.png alt="Bridgely sends questions via SMS"> Employee responses are stored in their directory record. The possibilities here really are&nbsp;endless!</p><h2 id=self-registration>Self-Registration</h2><p>Bridgely is deployed to a company via a pretty simple campaign: <em>Text your name to <strong>(999) 999-9999</strong> to receive occasional updates about&nbsp;<span class=caps>XYZ</span></em>.</p><h4 id=phone-numbers>Phone Numbers</h4><p>Bridgely utilizes Twilio for messaging capabilities. When Bridgely is set up for a company, it provisions a new phone number from Twilio to be used for sending and receiving text&nbsp;messages.</p><h4 id=autoresponders>Autoresponders</h4><p><img src=https://raw.github.com/nason/bridgely/master/screenshots/company_settings.png alt="Bridgely Company Settings"> Upon registering for mobile communications, Bridgely can respond with welcome text and an optional, uniquely generated link for each employee. This makes further analytics and subsequent integrated content delivery via the web&nbsp;possible.</p><h2 id=modern-messaging>Modern Messaging</h2><p><span class=caps>SMS</span> is widely available, and for the most part unused by employers to communicate with employees. Changing that is simple with&nbsp;Bridgely.</p><h4 id=sms-broadcast><span class=caps>SMS</span> Broadcast</h4><p>Companies can send messages to any number of employees. Employees can be selected one-by-one or filtered by any criteria that has been stored in employee records. <img src=https://raw.github.com/nason/bridgely/master/screenshots/filter_employees.png alt="Employee directories are filterable by any employee data, including question responses"> Alternatively, the company’s entire mobile directory can easily be selected for&nbsp;messaging.</p><h4 id=message-variables>Message Variables</h4><p>When composing a new message in Bridgely, a few variables are&nbsp;available:</p><ul><li>Unique welcome link (the same one that was sent in the autoresponder, if&nbsp;enabled)</li><li>Company name</li><li>Employee’s first name</li></ul><p>Using the recipient’s name in a message is a nice touch that helps the communications seem less robotic and more&nbsp;personal.</p><h4 id=asking-questions>Asking Questions</h4><p>This one is huge! Leveraging the message broadcasting capabilities of Bridgely is powerful in itself; the ability to ask questions and process responses is&nbsp;massive.</p><h2 id=tech-stack>Tech Stack</h2><p>Bridgely is an open-source application made up of two separate components: the frontend and the backend. Both are freely available and easily&nbsp;extensible.</p><h3 id=backend>Backend</h3><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I learned Ruby on Rails for this project. In that light, I welcome any code review and/or pull&nbsp;requests</p><p>The Bridgely backend is a RESTful Rails 4 <span class=caps>API</span>. It uses the rails-api gem to keep the app as lightweight as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>The <span class=caps>API</span> has three main types of&nbsp;functionality:</p><ol><li>Serving <span class=caps>JSON</span> data to the&nbsp;frontend</li><li>Receiving and sending message data to&nbsp;Twilio</li><li>Maintaining a database of all messages, employees, and employee response&nbsp;data</li></ol><p>More information about the Bridgely <span class=caps>API</span> can be found on GitHub at <a href=https://github.com/nason.bridgely-api>https://github.com/nason.bridgely-api</a></p><h3 id=frontend>Frontend</h3><p>The Bridgely frontend is a lightweight Backbone.js single page application. It incorporates Backgrid and some of its plugins for tabular data and filtering, and has basic responsive styling based on Bootstrap. Functionally, it wraps the backend’s features in an easy to use&nbsp;interface.</p><p>The app will be used by a handful of people to reach thousands of employees. My goal was to design a lightweight, modular, and easily extensible web application. In this regard I think Bridgely’s frontend shines. Additional business logic can be added without interfering with Bridgely’s core functionality. It’s simple, clean&nbsp;code.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>All in all this was an awesome experience. Working with the ForUs team was a pleasure. During the three week project period I tackled new challenges and expanded my programming toolkit every day. I learned Ruby on Rails for Bridgely and anticipate this won’t be my last Rails&nbsp;project.</p><p>I was personally responsible for architecting Bridgely to meet ForUs’s business needs, developing and testing its code, and it felt so great to deliver a full-featured app on time! Very soon, Bridgely will start delivering helpful information to people across the country. I couldn’t ask for&nbsp;more.</p><p>You can find more about this project on GitHub: <a href=https://github.com/nason/bridgely>https://github.com/nason/bridgely</a>.
