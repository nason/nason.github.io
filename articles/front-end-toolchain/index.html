It’s nice to use the same language as the app. There are plenty of other options out there,&nbsp;too.</p><p>As far as actually running these tasks, I like to use <code>npm-scripts</code> as much as possible, and <code>gulp</code> for more complex&nbsp;areas.</p><h3 id=linting-style-checking>Linting + Style&nbsp;Checking</h3><blockquote><p>JavaScript is full of foot-guns. Don’t ignore the&nbsp;linter.</p></blockquote><p>A proper linter helps you detect common mistakes, avoid poorly understood language features, and generally write more maintainable&nbsp;code.</p><p>I recently switched to <code>ESLint</code> for it’s awesome <span class=caps>ES6</span> <span class=amp>&amp;</span> <span class=caps>JSX</span>&nbsp;support.</p><blockquote><p>A project should look like it was written by one&nbsp;person</p></blockquote><p>I find following a style guide makes a codebase easier to reason about. I use <code>jscs</code> for style&nbsp;checking.</p><p>Even if you don’t agree with a project’s style, maintaining <em>consistency</em> and <em>readability</em> helps others’ ability to jump in any time and be&nbsp;productive.</p><p>Style guides and linters compliment each other to help avoid both common and subtle&nbsp;pitfalls.</p><p>My linter and style checker typically run on source file change, and there are also some really nice editor plugins you can use to get instant visual feedback on lint/style&nbsp;warnings.</p><h3 id=documentation>Documentation</h3><blockquote><p>Always update docs when you update a module, and so&nbsp;on.</p></blockquote><p>Everyone has their own opinion on how code should be documented. My preference is to write <code>jsdoc</code> style comments, but whats really important here is keeping docs up to&nbsp;date.</p><p>That means making documentation a priority. Always update docs when you update a module, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>One team policy I experienced and really appreciated was: if you touch a module without any documentation, add at least a base level yourself. This was slightly painful but quickly led to much better and thorough&nbsp;documentation.</p><p>My projects tend to generate documentation when running a release task. I want to explore using something like <code>flow</code> annotations instead of just declaring types in doc&nbsp;comments.</p><h3 id=dependency-management-bundling>Dependency Management +&nbsp;Bundling</h3><blockquote><p><em>Anything</em> is better than dependency management via script&nbsp;tags.</p></blockquote><p>There ecosystem for dependency management in JavaScript is insane. I enjoy <code>browserify</code> and <code>webpack</code> a whole lot, but seriously <em>anything</em> is better than dependency management via script&nbsp;tags.</p><p>A bundle step will use your tool of choice to bundle your application. It can also pipe your code through transforms (for <span class=caps>JSX</span>, CoffeeScript, minification, or anything else you can&nbsp;imagine).</p><p>My bundle step typically has two modes: prod and dev. This is toggled by a condition&nbsp;like:</p><pre><code class=lang-javascript><span class=keyword>const</span> isProd = (process.env.NODE_ENV === <span class=string>'production'</span>);
</code></pre><p>In dev mode, we want the bundle task to output verbose, unoptimized code. We want a source map so we can easily debug. We want this to run quickly so it can be re-run on source changes right&nbsp;away.</p><p>In prod mode, we want optimized, minified output. We still want a source map, but it should be an external file (not inline). For a large codebase, its ok if a prod bundle task takes some&nbsp;time.</p><p>To avoid inconsistency, I like keeping as much of the actual bundle pipeline as possible the same for both build&nbsp;modes.</p><h3 id=live-reload-hot-module-replacement>Live Reload / Hot Module&nbsp;Replacement</h3><blockquote><p>I want my browser to update with my changes as soon as&nbsp;possible.</p></blockquote><p>Live reload is my favorite thing. When I make a change to a source file, I want my browser to update with that change as soon as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>There are many ways to do this. I like <code>browser-sync</code>, which does live reload and a whole lot&nbsp;more.</p><p>I recently built a React app using Webpack and <code>react-hot-loader</code>. Hot Module Replacement updates and re-executes just the code you changed <em>without refreshing the page</em>. It takes a bit of work to setup, but it is really refreshing (hehe) to work this&nbsp;way.</p><h3 id=tests>Tests</h3><p>A test harness is usually one of the first things I setup for a new project. I like <code>karma</code>, which you can use to run tests in just about any&nbsp;framework.</p><p>If possible, I like to have two modes for this task as well. The default is to run all the tests and quit. The other option is to run in <span class=caps>TDD</span> mode and re-run tests on&nbsp;changes.</p><p>You can also setup your test task to instrument your code for coverage and generate reports, or to hook into a <span class=caps>CI</span> system or cloud test&nbsp;runner.</p><h3 id=assets>Assets</h3><p>If you’re using a <span class=caps>CSS</span> pre- or post-processor you’ll need a task to output your final&nbsp;stylesheet(s).</p><p>Likewise, if you have any html or image assets, etc you’ll need a task to optimize and copy those over to your output&nbsp;directory.</p><p>Or, you could use bundler transforms and require your assets in your <span class=caps>JS</span>. I haven’t done that in a project yet, and am on the fence about the&nbsp;idea.</p><h3 id=dist-deployment>Dist / Deployment</h3><p>Running <code>npm run deploy</code> is always a&nbsp;thrill.</p><p>What “deploy” means is entirely specific to your project’s context. After taking a quick mental inventory of deploy tasks I’ve worked on, these are the types of things I think they typically&nbsp;do:</p><ul><li>bump version number</li><li>run production build&nbsp;tasks</li><li>upload assets to&nbsp;s3</li><li>copy files into other&nbsp;projects</li><li>output manifests</li><li>commit and push to deployment-specific&nbsp;branches</li></ul><h3 id=tinker-carefully>Tinker carefully</h3><p>The way I see it, tooling has a sizable impact on any projects&nbsp;success.</p><p>It can be fun and super rewarding to tinker with and improve. At the same time, it can get very complex and becomes easy to break in subtle&nbsp;ways.</p><p>I’ve found myself in this place too many times: <img src=http://i.imgur.com/pXTKc2B.gif alt=""></p><p>So, treat your tooling code like you would application code. Track it, check it into <span class=caps>VCS</span>, put it through code review etc, and you won’t get burned. <em>This is mostly a note to myself&nbsp;;)</em></p><h3 id=the-big-picture>The big picture</h3><p>Effective tooling transports a complex JavaScript application from the wild west to modern&nbsp;times.</p><p>With one command, any of my teammates can start a local development server that responds to code changes, runs tests, checks for style and lint violations, and generates coverage and file size&nbsp;reports.</p><p>By setting a single environment variable, they can do the exact same thing with production-ready&nbsp;output.</p><p>And with one slightly different command they can deploy the application, using the same&nbsp;tools.</p><p>I could probably go on forever about this stuff, but I’m going to cut myself off here. Feel free to reach out if you have questions, and thanks for&nbsp;reading!</p></section><footer><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>var disqus_shortname = 'nason';
